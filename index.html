       <br></br>
       <article><big>   First take the container and put the battery box in it. Then take the receiver and connect it to the battery box and place it on the opposite side.Then take the two motors and attach both of them together using to black pins where their wires come out. Then attach the 1 by 5 at the holes on the side using the black pins. Then put the motors in your container then connect  the wires of the motor to the receiver make sure that <b>all</b> the wires are below the motors the motors should also touch the bottom of the container. then using the marker mark the place where the motor's spinning place is. Then take all the machinery out of the container.(This part shouldbe done by an adult) take the screwdriver and heat it then using it pierce a hole in the container where you marked it the put the axel inside the hole if it spins freely then it is good if it takes some stregth to spin it then make the hole bigger if the axel does not fit then make the hole bigger but if the hole is to ig then get a new container. After the hole is created then put all the macinery back in. Then take the straw and cutit in the middle if the straw is small then get another one and do not cut it. Then put the axel through the sraw but leave some space on the axel so the axel can be put in the motor. Now take the baterry box and cut some double-sided tape using scissors and put the double-sided tape on the battery box and place battery  as close to the motors as you can. Now cut some double-sided tape using scissors and put the double-sided tape on the bottom of the receiver and place te receiver at the edge of the container. Then test if the receiver can pickup the remote's signal and test if it can float. BTW make sure the front is where the receiver is.
